# Occupation Data Analysis

This project involves the analysis of occupation-related data using Python and the Pandas library. The dataset provides information about different occupations and their associated attributes.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Python code for analyzing occupation-related data using the Pandas library. The analysis includes steps to load the dataset, group and aggregate data, and calculate various statistics related to occupation, gender, and age. The primary goals of this project are:

- Load the occupation dataset using Pandas.
- Calculate the mean age per occupation.
- Calculate the male ratio per occupation and sort it.
- Calculate the minimum and maximum ages per occupation.
- Calculate the mean age for each combination of occupation and gender.
- Present the percentage of women and men for each occupation.

## Analysis Steps

1. Import the necessary libraries, including Pandas and NumPy.
2. Import the occupation dataset from a reliable source.
3. Assign the dataset to a variable named `users`.
4. Calculate the mean age per occupation.
5. Calculate the male ratio per occupation and sort it from most to least.
6. Calculate the minimum and maximum ages for each occupation.
7. Calculate the mean age for each combination of occupation and gender.
8. Present the percentage of women and men for each occupation.
